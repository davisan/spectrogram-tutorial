# spectrogram-tutorial

This is a walkthrough of how to make spectrograms in python that are customized
for human speech research.  Many more details about how spectrograms are made
can be found in the Praat manual (see especially the topics `Spectrogram`,
`Power spectral density`, `Sound: To Spectrogram...`, and `Advanced spectrogram
settings`).
